# Map Tile Adapter
Reproject map tiles in the browser.
- **Problem:** Your map uses projection X but you've got requirements to show map tiles that are projected in Y.
- **Solution:** Use `map-tile-adapter` to reproject your map tiles in the browser.

## WARNING
This project is in beta and subject to breaking API changes. Documentation and improved test coverage will be provided in the near future.

## Purpose 
This library is for when your map projection differs from your tile projection. 

In a perfect world your map tiles would be in the same projection as your map. However, this is not always the case. Sometimes you may need to mix. For example,
- Your map and some of your tiles are in EPSG:3857 (web mercator), but you need to another tileset that is only served in EPSG:4326. 
- Your map is in some exotic projection and there are only EPSG:3857 tile providers.

With `map-tile-adapter`, you can proxy those tiles on the fly so that you can use those tiles.

## Tradeoffs
Map tiles are best used in their native projection. Reprojecting a tile almost always be suboptimal and most easily visualized in the following ways.

Use params like `interval`, `zoomOffset`, etc. to dial in the adapter to your needs.

### Visual effects
- **Text labels** will likely be distorted when reprojecting raster images. Labels are placed and "burned" into tiles. So when tile reprojects those labels will transform with the terrain. Those labels may also be smaller or larger due to scale differences.
- **Pixel precision** will likely be blured or pixelated.

## API

### Maplibre GL Adapter

#### Example 
```typescript
import maplibregl from 'maplibre-gl';
import { maplibreTileAdapterProtocol, epsg4326ToEpsg3857Presets } from 'map-tile-adapter';

const mtaProtocol = maplibreTileAdapterProtocol({
  // Converts EPSG:4326 tile endpoint to EPSG:3857
  ...epsg4326ToEpsg3857Presets(),
  // Draw EPSG:3857 tile in 256 pixel width by 1 pixel height intervals (more accurate latitude)
  interval: [256, 1] 
});

maplibregl.addProtocol(
  mtaProtocol.protocol, 
  mtaProtocol.loader
);

const map = new maplibregl.Map({
  style: {
    ...,
    sources: {
      version: 8,
      epsg4326Source: {
        type: 'raster',
        tiles: ['mta://bbox={bbox-epsg-3857}&z={z}&x={x}&y={y}://https://api.tilehost.com/map/{sz}/{sx}/{sy}.png'],
        tileSize: 256,
        scheme: 'xyz'
      } 
    },
    layers: [
      { id: 'mtaLayer', source: 'epsg4326Source', type: 'raster' }
    ]
  }
})
```

## Development
1. Update the `CHANGELOG.md` with new version and commit the change.
1. Run `npm version ...` or somethign similar or tag manually
1. Push tag to remote `git push --tags`
1. Manually create a release in github which will trigger npm publish in github action
